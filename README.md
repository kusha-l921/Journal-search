# AI Journal Recommender for Researchers

##  Problem Statement

Researchers often struggle to find the best journals for publishing their papers. Challenges include:

* Journals not covering the right topics
* Low acceptance chances
* Lack of awareness about relevant journals
* Hours wasted manually scouting

##  Goal

Build an AI-powered tool that recommends the **top 3 most suitable journals** for a research paper by analyzing its **title and abstract**.

##  Features

* **Content Analyzer**: Extracts key topics, themes, and keywords from the paper’s title and abstract.
* **Journal Matcher**: Matches papers against a curated journal database using semantic similarity scoring.
* **Smart Filtering**: Refine results by subject area, impact factor, or acceptance rate.
* **Simple I/O**: Paste title & abstract → Get ranked journal suggestions with rationale + direct submission links.
* **Bonus Insights**: Estimated acceptance odds + “underdog” journals with higher chances.

##  System Architecture

1. **Input Layer** → Research title + abstract
2. **Content Analyzer** → Extracts keywords & context
3. **Journal Matcher** → Compares with journal database (using semantic similarity)
4. **Filtering Module** → Applies user preferences (impact factor, domain, etc.)
5. **Output Layer** → Top 3 journals + insights + submission links

##  Target Users

* Early-career researchers
* Interdisciplinary scholars
* Academics aiming to save time & maximize publication success

##  Market Research

* Thousands of academic journals exist globally
* Journal selection is one of the top challenges for researchers
* Growing need for AI-driven tools in academic publishing

##  Competitive Edge

Unlike existing tools, this project provides:

* AI-based semantic matching (not just keyword search)
* Actionable insights with rationale for recommendations
* Focus on **top 3 journals** to reduce overwhelm

##  Future Roadmap

*  Journal recommendation (current)
*  Add acceptance probability prediction
*  Personalize suggestions based on user profiles
*  Trend visualization of top journals in a domain
*  Integration with external submission platforms

##  Dataset

* Source: [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/)
* Used for journal metadata, topics, and metrics
